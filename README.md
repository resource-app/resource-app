RESOURCE


A reliable, community driven, open source project designed to assist the consumer public
in identifying and overcoming regional shortages in times of crisis.
	

	Using community input...

		- Identifies shortages of products by region.
		- Gauges real life inventories of shortage items by store.
		- Gives insight into any special rules or restrictions in a store.
			(4 rolls of TP per customer)

	App allows a user to quickly...

		- Become better aware of real shortages in their area,
			reducing overbuying, and assisting in appropriate planning
		- Search for a needed item or set of items,
			returning a list of stores within x miles with known inventory
		- See stores stocked with shortage items,
			update their app with updated info about supply seamlessly


The community will be critical to the function of this project. In light of the current global crisis,
I see strangers asking each other where they can find toilet paper and hand sanitizer. 
People who are nervous, grasping for leads on hard-to-find items.

Happy people, when they find the item the've been to six stores attempting to find. 

It seems the problem is not always so difficult to overcome.
In a store just one town away, your item may be stocked, but you may not know it.
The cumulative attrition caused by an endless -- or worse, fruitless -- search quickly wears a person out.
There needs to be a neutral system in place that does not allow exploitative advertising or irresponsible overbuying
to control the results of supply and demand.

Here is where I envision RESOURCE coming in.
People want to help their neighbors; this project is about giving the public a lightweight and useful tool
to find the things they need to continue living normally, while providing a great opportunity to support each other
in a time where strong bonds can be formed.


	I am looking for...

		Developers:
			Rapid development, databasing, apps, cross platform development,
			web development, UI development, any experience in consumer products.
				       (my fluent programming language is python,
					we will identify best frameworks
					for our purpose.)
			If you can help make this idea reality,
			we want you.

		Testers:
			If you want to help make this app exacty what people really need,
			we want you.

		Contributers:
			If you are looking for a way to help, it is welcome here.
			I am interested in ALL thoughts on creating something that 
			truly helps.

	This is a completely new project, open at this point to major direction decisions.  
	Best ideas and methods will be incorporated, but the focus is getting this into
	people's hands ASAP.


I see this as an immediate need for rapid development, and it is beyond my scope to achieve alone.
This is a NOT FOR PROFIT project. I am not interested in profiting on this project,
and would not be attempting to organize it if I did not feel it was of upmost importance.
I am offering to create, coordinate, and manage the project to the best of my ability,
for the good of regular people, everywhere.
